# python-greetings
Really simple pythong application for study purposes and usage of it in CI/CD pipelines. 

To start and use this application:

1. Install the required package using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `python app.py` to run application
3.  Open a web browser or a tool like curl and visit `http://localhost:3000/greetings`. You should see a JSON response like {"greeting": "Hello from Python App!"}.
